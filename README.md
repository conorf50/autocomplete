Basic autocomplete java programme with CLI interface

###Outline
This programme reads in values from a list of values aand stores them in memory. Then the user can search against these terms for a prefix such
as "Hel" for the word "Hello".
You can also specify the mode to use (quick or brute force).
It has been designed to be easy to use, implementing a basic number driven shell to do the user interaction

###How to use

Simply open the programme Eclipse or as a standalone application (planned feature) The user will then see a CLI with the following options
1: Specify a URL  (defaults to the wiki.txt file in the root of the project)
2: Enter prefix 
3: Change autocomplete mode  (currently not implemented)

These options are self-explanatory and very basic, the actual sorting algorithms are the real focus of this project. This example uses Java's built in BinarySearch algorithm to simplify the code
