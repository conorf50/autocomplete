Basic autocomplete java programme with CLI interface

###Outline
This programme reads in values from a list of values aand stores them in memory. Then the user can search against these terms for a prefix such
as "Hel" for the word "Hello".
You can also specify the mode to use (quick or brute force).
It has been designed to be easy to use, implementing the Cliche shell to do the user interaction

###How to use

Simply open the programme Eclipse or as a standalone application (planned feature) The user will then see a CLI with the following options
1: Specify a URL
2: Enter prefix 
3: Change autocomplete mode

These options are self-explanatory and very basic, the actual sorting algorithms are the real focus of this project.
